# Java Learning Journey: Mastering Fundamentals and Key Technologies

## Description

Welcome to my Java learning repository! Here, you'll find a series of projects and documentation reflecting my progress in mastering Java, from core fundamentals to advanced technologies like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and batch processing with Spring Batch. This repository documents my evolution as a developer and serves as a portfolio to share my knowledge and projects with the developer community.

Each section and project is designed to tackle specific concepts and help build the key skills required to become a **Junior Java Developer** or beyond.

## Core Fundamentals and Key Technologies

1. **Java SE:**
   - Master the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
   - Understand and apply collections (`List`, `Set`, `Map`) and Generics.
   - Handle exceptions correctly.
   - Deepen knowledge of the JVM, memory management, and garbage collection.

2. **Multithreading and Concurrency:**
   - Learn to manage multiple threads and concurrent tasks to create efficient, thread-safe applications.
   - Apply synchronization techniques and avoid concurrency issues like deadlocks and race conditions.

3. **Spring Boot and Hibernate:**
   - Develop enterprise applications with **Spring Boot**, including creating RESTful APIs.
   - Implement Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with **Hibernate** to manage relational databases.

## Specific Skills

1. **Batch Applications with Spring Batch:**
   - Process large volumes of data using Spring Batch and its batch-oriented job handling.
   - Connect batch applications to relational databases using JDBC for efficient data handling.

2. **JDBC and Relational Databases:**
   - Create database connections and manage data using **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**.
   - Use **PreparedStatements** to prevent SQL Injection and ensure transactional integrity.

3. **Basic Frontend Skills:**
   - Learn the basics of **JavaScript** and DOM manipulation to interact with web pages.
   - Implement asynchronous requests with **AJAX** or the **Fetch API** for simple web applications.

## Best Practices and Optimization

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement techniques to improve the performance of low-latency, high-throughput applications.
   - Apply patterns and tools to reduce JVM load and optimize resource usage.

2. **Development Best Practices:**
   - Use **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** to write quality code and ensure functionality.
   - Manage code versions with **Git** to keep organized tracking of changes.
   - Implement **CI/CD** pipelines with tools like Jenkins and Docker to automate integration and deployment processes.

## Projects

Hereâ€™s a list of projects I've developed throughout my learning process, covering the areas mentioned:

1. **[Task Manager](./projects/task-manager/)**  
   A simple project to create, edit, and delete tasks stored in a local database using JDBC. This project covers the basics of Java SE and JDBC.

2. **[Restaurant Reservation System](./projects/restaurant-reservation-system/)**  
   A web application built with **Spring Boot** and **Hibernate** that allows users to manage restaurant reservations. Implements a REST API for CRUD operations.

3. **[Order Batch Processor](./projects/order-batch-processor/)**  
   A batch application that processes large volumes of customer orders using **Spring Batch**. Connects to a relational database using JDBC.

4. **[Real-Time Chat Application](./projects/realtime-chat-app/)**  
   A real-time messaging system built with **Java multithreading** and **WebSockets** to handle multiple concurrent connections.

5. **[Inventory Management System](./projects/inventory-management-system/)**  
   A full-fledged enterprise application for managing inventory, developed with **Spring Boot** and tested with **JUnit**, following **TDD** principles.

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing advanced projects that cover topics like performance optimization for low-latency applications.
2. Implement new technologies and design patterns to improve code scalability and maintainability.
3. Explore continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) in my projects.
